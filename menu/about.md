Hi I'm Dave. I was a co-founder at [Standard AI](https://www.standard.ai) for five years. Before that I worked at various startups and got a PhD in math. Currently I'm pondering a new startup. I like to write about entrepreneurship, deep learning, philosophy, mathematics and travel. 

If you'd like to get in touch ping me on social media or <a href="mailto:dmvaldman@gmail.com">email me</a>.
