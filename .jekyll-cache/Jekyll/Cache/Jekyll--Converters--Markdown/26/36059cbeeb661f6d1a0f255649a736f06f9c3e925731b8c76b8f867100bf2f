“Where are you going camping?” a friend asked. “North.” I said.</p>

<p>Two days later, with that plan in hand, I left San Francisco for a 3-day motorcycle camping trip up Highway 1.</p>

<p>This is a story about creating space for the unfamiliar.</p>

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>

<p>I needed to use the bathroom. In a hurry, I stopped at the first restaurant I came across and walked into this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1*_w2mHcYEJxG_PLzwHvU7HQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There was a table with a medley of Russian plates and a sign that read, “Welcome! Please help yourself with food and pay from your wisdom.”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1*nS55ajJeEthEZSdEu5TfIg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I tiptoed around looking for staff while trying to balance the material need to pee and the abstract desire to comprehend this alternate universe.</p>

<p>“The bathroom is out back,” she said frankly.</p>

<p>In the bathroom was an ad for a chef. No cooking experience necessary, salary $0/yr.</p>

<p>I mentioned I was going to stay at a campsite nearby and they offered me their trailer out back. I washed their dishes that night and swept their floors the next morning.</p>

<p>We became friends. They asked if I could stay longer, but I had to say no.</p>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>

<p>After riding for 30 miles without seeing a gas station I began to worry. I stopped by a local general store in Elk, a vestige of a forgotten logging town with population tipping over 200.</p>

<p>“Where’s the nearest gas station?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Albion. 15 miles North,” the lady at the counter said proudly.</p>

<p>With a gas tank near empty, I rolled up a poorly maintained side road to Albion Grocery. Outside were two analog pumps: regular and premium. A man ahead of me was filling up reserve jugs and loading them onto his truck.</p>

<p>This gas station is not on Google maps though it’s existed since 1974. I found it by chance and it saved me from being stranded.</p>

<p>I left thinking “Albion” is a great name for a post-apocalyptic town.</p>

<p>I turned on Highway 128 towards Hendry Grove, a Redwood park where I’d set up camp for the night. The road follows the Navarro River Redwoods: 15 miles of a twisty two-lane highway through thick forest.</p>

<p>For 30 minutes I glided though an aspect-ratio of long, narrow and tall.</p>

<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>

<p>Redwood groves are pretty during the day, but boy do they get cold at night. In the morning I walked to the bathrooms when a campmate waved me over.</p>

<p>“Chilly huh? Fell below freezing last night” he said.</p>

<p>While making coffee I reminded myself of the last time I was this cold. The memory came distinctly, vividly.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1*nSc7Gje8RT2seW2fibcekg.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The last thing you want to do when you’re cold is ride a motorcycle. I stopped often to warm up, but everywhere I stopped I was cold.</p>

<p>As I rode from the coast to the Central Valley the skies cleared and I could feel the sun at my back all the way to San Francisco.</p>

<p>My experience of this trip is encapsulated in a place I visited along the way.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1*GAg5SoMcZDqWLKHzaUsRFQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just outside the town of Sea Ranch is a <a href="http://www.thesearanchchapel.org/">chapel</a>. Everything about its design and construction is strange. The craftsmanship is evident, but the specifications are a mystery.</p>

<p>The patterns are foreign. The proportions are odd. Pieces fit crookedly. Lines meet at curves. Shapes meet at folds. Textures come and go.</p>

<p>From the outside, you are at a loss to describe its volume. From the inside, you are at a loss to describe its shape.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1*f05id75_uMwDoyOfpebEwA.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was made as if to create separation from this world; so that when you step inside, you are compelled to create your own.</p>

<p>It was made to be unfamiliar; so that when you experience it, you experience yourself more than the place.</p>
